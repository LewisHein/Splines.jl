# Splines

This is a package that provides 1-D cubic splines, with a particular eye to using them to represent functions in functional data analysis. Thus, Splines.jl provides a basic Spline type, and several useful operators:

 - Addition/subtraction: defined pointwise as for functions
 - Scalar multiplication/division
 - Discretization
 - Differentiation
 - find max and min
 - Insert and delete knot/value pairs
 - Trim domain

## Installation

Installation should be just as for any unregistered julia package
